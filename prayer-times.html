You can name the downloaded file something short and descriptive so itâ€™s easy to remember and link to on GitHub Pages. I recommend:

```
prayer-times.html
```

This way your final public link will look clean, for example:
```
https://your-username.github.io/prayer-times/prayer-times.html?lat=54.464169&lng=-110.182503&method=12&shafaq=general&fixFajr=04:30&fixAsr=18:00&fixJummah=13:30
```

If you upload it into the root of your repository and name it exactly `index.html`, the link can be even shorter:
```
https://your-username.github.io/prayer-times/?lat=54.464169&lng=-110.182503&method=12&shafaq=general&fixFajr=04:30&fixAsr=18:00&fixJummah=13:30
```
